## readme
this code is for wsdm2024 ISMCN.

In consideration of user privacy and related policies, we open source the part related to the model including the detection models and explainers.
Among them, ```model ```,```main.py``` and ```fp_main.py ``` are codes related to the detection model.

```explainer_categorical ```,```explainer_numerical```, ```explainer_final```, ```explainer_main.py``` and ```explainer_main_fp.py ```are codes related to the explainers. Among them, ```explainer_main.py``` and ```explainer_main_fp.py ``` are the ISMCN codes that explain the detection models on datasets A and B corresponding to the original paper.
